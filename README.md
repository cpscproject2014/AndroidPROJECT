Description:
(1) Title (10 words max) 
Payitback— make sure your friends pay you back.

(2) Short Description (50 words max)                
This app keeps track of money owed to you by friends and sends them a gentle text reminder in 24 hours to pay you back! It is a flexible method of tracking money when a friend cannot Venmo you the money or does not have cash on hand.  

(3) Detailed Description (500 words max) 
Keeping track of the money my friends owe me is rather cumbersome, especially when it’s a couple of dollars here and there. Sometimes I completely forget about it, while other times I feel awkward asking for a couple dollars back. There have been several instances in which I lend my friends money and we completely forget about it since we don’t record it. Over time, this sum definitely adds up.

An app that sums the amount of money owed will be useful for ensuring that both parties are aware of the transaction. People even forget whether they actually paid back the amount they borrowed, so having an app that documents that is important. An important second component is that this app will automatically send a text after 24 hours (or a scheduled time) to the person that borrowed the money. This will be a gentle reminder that they need to pay the person back, in case they forgot. This can be changed to different time intervals (for example, you know that you won’t see the person again until a month later). This addresses the issue I often have of just asking a person for money they owe you weeks later.

I am aware there are apps such as Venmo that exist. However, several of my friends do not like using Venmo since they don’t want to link their bank account to it and prefer using cash instead. Additionally, they might not have the money in their account to pay on the spot, so this app gives them time to pay it back. I envision the main interface to be very minimalistic, only asking WHO owes you money, HOW much, and a send button. There can be a default option of sending a text in 24 hours, but that can be changed in another screen. Additionally, there can be a notes section so the user can remember what the person is paying them back for. This app will also record the date of transaction, so that people will be motivated to pay their money back quickly. All of the amount owed will be summed, but the user can look at the details of the time, details, and amount owed.

Another useful function this app can have is to “split” costs. For example, I had to create an Excel spreadsheet this summer to track expenses that needed to be split, such as groceries, with my housemates. This app can have a built in function that splits an expense among 2 or more people and adds that into the amount owed. This is also especially helpful when splitting the costs of a meal among several people. It gives the person who pays the check assurance that he will actually be paid back. I think there are many opportunities to add extra functions into this app, such as sending money requests to people. Ideally, this app could be linked to Venmo in the long run!
